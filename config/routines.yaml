# Dobby Display Routines Configuration
# Define countdown routines with their triggers and settings
# Countdown logic:
# - Church: ONLY shows on Sunday if there's a "Church" event on the calendar (require_event: true)
# - School: Shows Mon-Fri at 7:30 AM (fixed time, no event required)
# - Bedtime: Shows daily at 7:45 PM (fixed time, no event required)

routines:
  # Church - Sundays at 10am, show countdown 15 min before (only if Church event exists!)
  - name: "Church"
    trigger_calendar: "Me and You"
    trigger_event_contains: "Church"
    trigger_days: [0]  # Sunday only
    event_time: "10:00"
    leave_minutes_before: 15
    require_event: true  # ONLY show if Church event exists on calendar
    enabled: true

  # Take Franklin to school - weekday mornings at 7:30 AM
